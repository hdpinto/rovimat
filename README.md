## Comments

With limited time and budget I came up with this webiste - I did not use any templating engine or MV* framework, but I used some basic Javascript on the home page to create a rotating review widget with pre-filled reviews taken from two of the client's social websites. I apologise for the mess, time constraints during the execution of this project prevented me from properly cleaning up the directory before launch, and post launch I was no longer getting paid to maintain the website so I just stopped working on it.
